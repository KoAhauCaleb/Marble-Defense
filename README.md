# Overview

This is the beginings of a tower defense game. Currently it is simply a single unity scene where you defeat enemies by controling a cannon that points towards you mouse pointer.
You can defeat enemies by dealing enough damage to them, and you can deal damage faster by upgradeing by clicking on the cannon. Upgrades cost money which is gained each time you defeat an enemy.

I wrote this to see if game development was something I would enjoy. It was fun, and while I hope to be able to come back to it, there are other things I enjoy more. I was working on this project during mid-terms so I couldn't focus on it as much as I wanted to and would like to polish it at the very least.

# Development Environment

I created this using Unity. I did all my programing with Visual Studio Code. It was writen in C# and curently, besides the libraries included in every Unity project, it's using TextMeshPro to display the money the user has.
